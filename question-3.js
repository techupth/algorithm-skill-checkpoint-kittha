/*
What is the Big O notation for Function findStudentById . Explain your reason.
Answer:
O(n)
it's runtime grows linear with input size

*/

/* 
What is the Big O notation for Function findProductPrice. Explain your reason.
Answer:
O(log n)
it's input size was divided by 2; so it's runtime grows at very slower rate
*/

/* 
Which function is more efficient and why?
Answer:
Function findProductPrice (O(log n)) has better performance than 
Function findStudentById (O(n)).
Because of it's lower time complexity.
